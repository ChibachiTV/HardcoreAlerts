# HardcoreAlerts
Right now this is very bare-bones! I just had an idea about parsing the alerts coming in from HardcoreDeaths chat channel directly from Blizzard and it ended up being speedier than DeathLog. From there, I've started customizing things, such as level highlighting in relation to your own level (red, orange, yellow, green, grey), adding my own custom death announcements, and setting different variables for when something sends an alert. 

I plan on everything being customizable with a simple settings screen, but for now everything is hard-coded. 

Currently it's not much different from Blizzard's default implementation with an added resizable window for tracking people's deaths, and a sound effect played for everyone around your level and over. Again, settings I will eventually make user-changable.
