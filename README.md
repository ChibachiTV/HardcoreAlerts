# Hardcore Alerts
A lightweight World of Warcraft addon to track and display player deaths.

## Features
- Track Player Deaths: Automatically logs the name, cause of death, and the zone where each death occurred.
- Death Alert: Automatically show an on-screen alert of a death on your realm.
- Minimal UI Footprint: A clean and lightweight design that integrates seamlessly with your WoW interface.

## Installation
1. Download the files into your addon folder (/AddOns/HardcoreAlerts/)
2. Restart WoW and enable the addon in the Addons menu.

I'll eventually make a release and put it on a website like CurseForge.

## How to Use
1. Enable Hardcore Death Announcements and set them to ALL DEATHS.
* (Hardcore Death Alerts can be 'never' and it still works fine.)
2. Join the 'HardcoreDeaths' channel. You can hide this channel in your chat settings.
3. Use /hcalerts for commands.

## Commands
- /hcalerts reset    - Clears the death log.
- /hcalerts show     - Shows the death tracker window.
- /hcalerts hide     - Hides the death tracker window.
