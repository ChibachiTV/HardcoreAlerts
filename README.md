# HardcoreAlerts
A World of Warcraft addon that hooks directly with Blizzard's realm-wide player death alerts giving a light-weight, speedier alternative to DeathLog. 

Right now this is very bare-bones! I just had an idea about parsing the alerts coming in from HardcoreDeaths chat channel directly from Blizzard and it ended up being speedier than DeathLog. From there, I've started customizing things, such as level highlighting in relation to your own level (red, orange, yellow, green, grey), adding my own custom death announcements, and setting different variables for when something sends an alert. 

I plan on everything being customizable with a simple settings screen, but for now everything is hard-coded.
