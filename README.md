# Hardcore Alerts
Right now this is very bare-bones! I just had an idea about parsing the alerts coming in from HardcoreDeaths chat channel directly from Blizzard and it ended up being speedier than DeathLog. From there, I've started customizing things, such as level highlighting in relation to your own level (red, orange, yellow, green, grey), adding my own custom death announcements, and setting different variables for when something sends an alert. 

I plan on everything being customizable with a simple settings screen, but for now everything is hard-coded. 

Currently it's not much different from Blizzard's default implementation with an added resizable window for tracking people's deaths, and a sound effect played for everyone around your level and over. Again, settings I will eventually make user-changable.

(Apologies for using people's actual in-game names for the wip screenshots)

Also! DeathLog is a fantastic addon that in no way shape or form is awful. I just had an urge to try and make something and it ended up being speedier. I don't intend of replicating DeathLog and will instead be looking for a way to make this addon unique in its own way.
